  "bodyText": "Cultured Kids Cuisine (CKC) is a non-profit organization striving to build a future of love and tolerance through food. As part of the many initiatives started by CKC, I created short educational videos focused on exploring food history and its impact on culture. The project was short-lived, only consisted of two videos, which are available on my Youtube channel.\n\nThe first video explores the curious creation of General Tso's chicken and the history of American Chinese food as it relates to the Chinese immigrant experience in the United States. The second video explores the creation of saltfish and ackee, and centers on Jamaica to tell a larger story of Caribbean history.\n\nBoth videos start with an animated historical overview of the context behind the featured dish, followed by a vlog montage and food review where I highlight a restaurant in NYC that sells the featured dish."
