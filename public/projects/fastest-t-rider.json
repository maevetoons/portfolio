  "bodyText": "I love trains. As a Brooklyn native, the enigmatic MTA subway system has captured my curiousity ever since I started learning to commute on my own.\n\nAbout a year ago, I stumbled upon the Wikipedia page for the Rapid Transit Challenge, a speedrunning challenge that started in the 40s as one man's sentimental gesture and has today evolved into a highly prized Guiness World Record title. The current record is held by Kate Jones at 22 hours, 14 minutes, and 10 seconds. In my current point in life, however, I seem to be stuck at university in Cambridge, and the 472 interwoven stations of the MTA are far out of reach. Then I thought to myself, ''Boston has a subway station too.'' (curiously dubbed the MBTA). And thus, I had my vision in mind. A much shorter record, a much simpler route, and mcuh closer to home."
