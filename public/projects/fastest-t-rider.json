  "bodyText": "The Fastest T Rider project began as a simple challenge: could someone visit every single MBTA subway station in Boston in the shortest time possible? What started as a fun idea evolved into a comprehensive documentary project that explores Boston's transit system, urban geography, and the communities connected by public transportation.\n\nThe project required extensive planning and optimization, including route analysis, schedule coordination, and timing strategies. Using data analysis and mapping tools, I developed the most efficient path through all 51 subway stations across the Red, Blue, Orange, and Green lines.\n\nBeyond the challenge itself, the video captures the diverse neighborhoods and communities that make up Boston, showing how public transit serves as the vital connective tissue of the city. The final production combines action-packed documentation of the record attempt with thoughtful commentary on urban planning and public transportation."
